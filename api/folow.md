CreateRecipeDto - For receiving new recipe data
UpdateRecipeDto - For receiving recipe updates

Update Authentication
Ensure JWT authentication is properly set up for secured endpoints
Add authorization attributes to controller methods that need authentication

Testing
Test all endpoints manually or with automated tests
Ensure authentication and authorization work correctly

Frontend Integration
If you're building a frontend, connect it to these API endpoints
Implement UI for recipe creation, editing, viewing, and saving

Documentation
Document your API endpoints
Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

Performance Optimization
Add pagination for recipe listings
Consider caching frequently accessed data

Deployment
Prepare for deployment with proper environment variables
Set up CI/CD pipeline if needed

6. Application Flow
   User Registration/Login:
   User registers via /api/Auth/register
   User logs in via /api/Auth/login and receives JWT token
   Token is stored by client application
   Creating Recipes:
   Authenticated user sends recipe data to /api/Recipe
   Server validates the data and creates a new recipe
   Recipe is associated with the current user as the author
   Browsing Recipes:
   Anyone can browse all recipes via /api/Recipe
   Detailed recipe view via /api/Recipe/{id}
   Current user's recipes available at /api/Recipe/user
   Saving Recipes:
   Authenticated user can save other users' recipes via /api/Recipe/{id}/save
   User can view their saved recipes via /api/Recipe/saved
   User can unsave recipes via /api/Recipe/{id}/save (DELETE method)
   Editing/Deleting Recipes:
   Only the recipe author can update/delete their recipes
